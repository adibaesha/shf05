         <p style="color:Red;"> <em> <b> <font size="5"> Computer, device for processing, storing, and displaying information. 
Computer once meant a person who did computations, but now the term almost universally refers to automated electronic machinery. 
The first section of this article focuses on modern digital electronic computers and their design, constituent parts, and applications. 
The second section covers the history of computing. </font> </b> </em> </p>

            <p style="color:white;"> <font size="4"> <i>The first computer that resembled the modern machines we see today was invented by Charles Babbage between 1833 and 1871.
He developed a device, the analytical engine, and worked on it for nearly 40 years. 
It was a mechanical computer that was powerful enough to perform simple calculations.
